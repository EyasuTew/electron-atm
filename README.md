## Reasons of why this application was developed

Some reasons for the appearance of this application are described [here](http://gabets.ru/electron-atm).

## Features 

This is a side project of my full-time job and only the features that I currently need in my everyday work are implemented. 

Currently only the basic stuff is working, such as:

 * Connecting to ATM host
 * Moving through almost all the basic states (ICC states are passed through as well)
 * Showing basic image screens, linked to the state
 * Checking the Card's financial institution based on FIT tables
 * Keyboard shortcuts: FDK (A-I), numeric(0-9), Esc, Enter and Backspace
 * Receiving states from host
 * Receiving screens from host
 * Receiving FITs (financial insitution tables) from host
 * Showing traces in a log area
 * Saving ATM configuration data (such as states, screens and FITs) and restoring it on application start
 * Crypto support: PIN block encryption, dynamic key exchange etc. (Triple DES double length key only)
 * State Navigator: updating screen image when jumping through the states
 * State Navigator: displaying state details when state sleected

Things to be implemented (very) soon:
 * Showing text upon the image screen
 * Saving the image path in user settings
 * ICC support
